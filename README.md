## 🛠️ What I Do Best

* ⚡ **Speed Tuner**
  Whether it's optimizing SQL queries or refactoring code, I ensure everything runs smoother than a greased lightning bolt.

* 🌍 **Scale Handler**
  From handling millions of records to implementing real-time search, I thrive on scaling challenges. If it's big, complex, and needs to run seamlessly, let me try this.

* 🔄 **Pattern Fanatic**
  Singleton, Factory, Observer, MVC—you name it, I've probably implemented it or played around with it. I believe in structured solutions that make code as elegant as a well-tailored suit.

* 🔄 **Adaptability Chameleon**
  New tech? Bring it on. Complex challenges? My favorite. I thrive in dynamic environments and love learning through practice.

## 📬 Let’s Connect
- 🔭 Open to **collaborations** around MERN, Next.js, Elasticsearch, Symfony, and high-scale systems.
- 💬 Always up for a chat about programming, tech trends, or anything code-related—if it involves building or breaking things with code, count me in!
- ♟️ Oh, and I can play chess—though my code is usually less prone to blunders than my opening moves.
